This prototype project illustrates how to embed Python in our C++ application
using boost::python library. 

The ScriptingEngine class is a wrapper for boost::python functionality. We
expose a C++ variable and then we execute a Python script. The
BoostPythonInterfaces.cpp contains the boost interfaces. The Python module is 
named "Anki" (yes it is an prototype for AnKi 3D engine) The boost interface has
a "bpi.h" extension and uses python::boost to expose C++ classes to Python. The
classes we expose are the Vec3 and Vec4. Both of them are using each other. See
the test.py for a sample script.

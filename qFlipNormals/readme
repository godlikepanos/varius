=====================
What is QFlipNormals?
=====================

This is a ultra simple project build in python and PyQt4. It is simple tool used
to flip colours in normal maps. Its is nothing special but it can be a nice
example of how to use PyQt4 (as well as Qt Designer and Qt Resource compiler).


=====================================
What are the supported image formats?
=====================================

png jpg and tga but you can add all the formats that Qt supports.


=================
How can I run it?
=================

Type in a terminal: python qflipnormals.py


=========================
What is the requirements?
=========================

You need python and PyQt4 installed on your system.


=================
What is build.sh?
=================

In case you make your own modifications in MainWdg.ui or resources.qrc or in any
image in gfx directory you have to rebuild a few python files. So *build.sh*
is here to automate this process.


===================
Is there a license?
===================

There is no license. Use the code as you like, no questions asked. The icons in
gfx directory are *stolen* KDE icons and they are probably licensed under GPL.
So you cannot use the icons in commercial products.
